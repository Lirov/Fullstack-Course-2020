    <h3>1. Classical Luxury</h3>
    <img id="inner_image" src="https://comelite-arch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Luxury-Interior-Design-5.jpg">
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>The neo-classical interior design style is inspired by the Greek and Roman architecture.</br>
      It features the grandness that is characteristic of these age-old designs with a modern twist.</br>
      It emulates elements like wall-beading (wainscoting), tall pillars and pilasters, grand ceilings, Greek key’s,
      egg and dart designs and more, with the help of modern materials. Mostly white color schemes with a grand chandelier or ceiling design are used in such interior designs.</br>
      Since the classical order of Greek and Roman designs still represents the height of luxury, emulating these elements even with a modern twist can result in the best luxury interior design possible.</p>

    <h3>2. Victorian Luxury</h3>
    <img id="inner_image" src="https://comelite-arch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Luxury-Interior-Design-6.jpg">
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>The Victorian style of interior design emulates the architecture used in the Victorian era.</br>
      This included the eclectic revival of other historic styles including Greek, Roman, Baroque, Rococo and more.</br>
      Mixed between these styles were accents of Asian and Middle Eastern influences.</br>
      These mostly included a warm color scheme, traditional furniture and other interior accessories and fittings.</br>
      These days, this style is used with a few contemporary flairs to create an amazing luxury interior design.</br>
      It’s mostly suited for villas or penthouse suites or even spacious independent houses. Since luxury Victorian is a combination of many independent styles, it features a large amount of visual stimulation.</br>
      Therefore, it does not look best in small spaces.</p>

    <h3>3. Traditional Luxury</h3>
    <img id="inner_image" src="https://comelite-arch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Luxury-Interior-Design-7.jpg">
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>The traditional version of luxury interior design utilizes strong wooden accents and warm colors.</br>
      The grandness of this kind of styling comes from epic detailing. There is a huge emphasis on woodwork, detailed carvings and moldings along with crafted furniture.</br>
      These specifications may seem very vague, but when coupled with warm lighting and grand light fixtures, you’ll get something truly phenomenal.</br>
      Since there is a lot of detailed finishing in the traditional style of interior design, it only looks good in large spaces – huge mansions and villas. Such detail can only hamper the visuals in a cramped, narrow and small space.</p>

    <h3>4. Baroque Luxury</h3>
    <img id="inner_image" src="https://comelite-arch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Luxury-Interior-Design-8.jpg">
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>The Baroque style was literally a movement that rose to defy the simplicity and starkness that arose when religious extremists stripped the churches of all décor – leaving no sculptures, artwork or decorations.
      This movement was known as reformation and the buildings of that era were extremely stark and severe. Therefore, the Baroque movement emerged as a protest against such extremity. It featured bold, bright colors, intense maximalism, loud paintings and sculptures along with warm colors.
      The Baroque style luxury interior design of this era employs the same visuals.
      Along with a use of bold colors and lighting, you can expect to see a lot of architectural sculpturing, gold accents, heavy ornamentation and lots of accessories.
      This style is very loud and displays the epitome of extravagance.</p>

    <h3>5. Rococo Luxury</h3>
    <img id="inner_image" src="https://comelite-arch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Luxury-Interior-Design-9.jpg">
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>The Rococo style used to be the darling theme of French aristocracy back in the eighteenth century.</br>
      It represents the tail end of the Baroque era, and features light pastel colors with gold accents to mark its identity.</br>
      Today, the Rococo style is emulated by using white backdrops with pastel themes with a touch of traditional.</br>
      The floor patterns in such interiors have large motifs while the ceilings are high and heavily molded.</br>
      However, the color scheme balances out the heavy ornamentation so the space doesn’t look overly stimulating.</br>
      This kind of luxury interior design also looks best in huge spaces – grand halls, ballrooms and villas.</p>
